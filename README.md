**Project:** 
Automated Image Segmentation for Sorting Recyclable Materials

**Project Aim:**

This project aims to develop an automated system that uses image segmentation to identify and
sort recyclable materials from mixed waste streams. The primary objective is to automate and
optimize the recycling process, traditionally dependent on manual sorting. By leveraging
advanced image analysis techniques, the system will enhance sorting efficiency and accuracy,
reducing the need for human intervention and minimizing errors.
The system will analyze images of waste to categorize materials like plastics, metals, and paper
while detecting non-recyclable contaminants such as food waste. The system's accuracy will
lead to higher-quality recycled materials and more efficient waste management. Additionally, the
project includes an opportunity for motivated members to develop a research paper based on
the findings, encouraging deeper exploration and contribution to the field.

**Key Points:**

1. Automated Image Segmentation: Utilize advanced AI techniques and machine
learning algorithms to accurately segment recyclable materials from mixed
waste streams.
2. Real-Time Processing: Employ real-time object detection and image classification
to enable efficient and continuous sorting operations.
3. High Accuracy: Achieve a high level of accuracy in material identification using
deep learning models and feature extraction techniques.
4. Robustness: Develop a system that is invariant to variations in lighting conditions,
object orientations, and material types.
5. Scalability: Design a system that can be easily scaled to accommodate
different recycling facility sizes and throughput requirements.

**Goals:**

1. Improve Sorting Efficiency: Reduce manual labor and increase sorting throughput.
2. Optimize Waste Management: Contribute to more sustainable and efficient
waste management practices.
3. Environmental Impact: Contribute to reducing environmental impact by
promoting recycling and waste reduction.
4. Research Opportunities: Provide a platform for research and development in the
field of image segmentation.
