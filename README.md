Project: Automated Image Segmentation for Sorting Recyclable Materials

Project Aim:
This project aims to develop an automated system that uses image segmentation to identify and
sort recyclable materials from mixed waste streams. The primary objective is to automate and
optimize the recycling process, traditionally dependent on manual sorting. By leveraging
advanced image analysis techniques, the system will enhance sorting efficiency and accuracy,
reducing the need for human intervention and minimizing errors.
The system will analyze images of waste to categorize materials like plastics, metals, and paper
while detecting non-recyclable contaminants such as food waste. The system's accuracy will
lead to higher-quality recycled materials and more efficient waste management. Additionally, the
project includes an opportunity for motivated members to develop a research paper based on
the findings, encouraging deeper exploration and contribution to the field.
